## Privacy

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Deep Research" Dify Plugin ("the Plugin") operates with respect to your data. The Plugin is designed to enhance Dify applications by providing web search capabilities via the Tavily API.

Please note: This policy specifically covers the data handled by the "Deep Research" Plugin. Dify's platform itself, and any other plugins or services you use, will have their own privacy policies.

1. Data Collected and Processed by the Plugin
The Deep Research Plugin processes the following types of data:

Search Queries: When your Dify application utilizes the Deep Research Plugin, the search query you provide (or that the LLM generates) is passed to the Plugin.

Tavily API Key: For the Plugin to function, you (as the Dify application owner/user) must provide your personal Tavily API Key within the Dify Plugin settings. This key is used by the Plugin solely for authenticating requests to the Tavily API.

The Plugin itself DOES NOT collect, store, or log any personal user data, search queries, or search results on its own.

2. How Data is Used
The data processed by the Plugin is used exclusively for the following purposes:

Facilitating Web Searches: Your search query and Tavily API Key are transmitted to the Tavily API to perform the requested web search.

Returning Search Results: The results obtained from the Tavily API (e.g., titles, URLs, snippets) are immediately returned to your Dify application for further processing by your LLM or workflow.

3. Data Storage
By the Plugin: The Deep Research Plugin does not store any search queries, search results, or your Tavily API key. It acts as a conduit between your Dify application and the Tavily API.

By Dify: Your Tavily API key is stored securely within your Dify instance's plugin settings, managed by the Dify platform itself. Dify's own privacy and security policies govern the storage and handling of this credential.

By Tavily: When the Plugin makes a request to the Tavily API, the search query is processed by Tavily. We encourage you to review Tavily's own Privacy Policy to understand how they handle data transmitted to their service: https://tavily.com/privacy-policy

4. Third-Party Services
The Deep Research Plugin relies on the Tavily API to perform web searches. Your search queries and API key are shared with Tavily for this purpose.

5. Your Control and Consent
By providing your Tavily API Key in the Dify Plugin settings, you consent to the Plugin using that key to make requests to the Tavily API on your behalf. You retain full control over your Tavily API Key within your Dify environment, including the ability to revoke or change it at any time through the Dify UI.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated plugin package and its documentation. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically.

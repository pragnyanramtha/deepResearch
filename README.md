```
### 2. Upload to Dify
- Access your Dify UI.

- Navigate to the "Plugins" section in the left sidebar.

- Click the "Install" button (or "Add Plugin") in the top right.(or install plugin directlyÂ from marketplace(if availableÂ ))

- Select "Install via Local File".

- Upload the deep_research_plugin.difypkg file you just created.

## ðŸ”‘ Configuration & Credentials
After installing the plugin, you must provide your Tavily API Key:

In the Dify UI, go to the "Plugins" section.

Find and click on your "Deep Research" plugin.

Click the "Authorize" or "Settings" button (usually a key icon or cogwheel).

In the displayed form, enter your Tavily API Key into the designated field.

Click "Save" or "Authorize" to apply the changes.

Connection Requirements:

Your Dify instance must have outbound internet access to reach the Tavily API at api.tavily.com (port 443 for HTTPS).

The Dify plugin_daemon service (or the api service if plugin_daemon is integrated) needs to be running and healthy within your Dify Docker environment.

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Instructions
Once installed and configured, you can integrate "Deep Research" into your Dify applications.

### 1. Enable Plugin in Your Application
Go to "Studio" (or "Applications") in Dify.

Create a new application (e.g., a "Chatflow" or "Agent") or open an existing one.

On the orchestration canvas, locate the "Tools" section (often on the right sidebar or within the LLM node configuration).

Enable the "Deep Research" plugin by selecting it from the list.

### 2. Prompting Your AI (Chatflow/Agent Applications)
For conversational applications, the LLM will intelligently decide when to use the tool based on your prompt and the user's input. Craft your System Prompt to guide the LLM's usage:

```
You are an intelligent research assistant capable of performing real-time web searches.
You have access to the "Deep Research" tool.
When the user asks a question that requires current, external, or factual information, you MUST use the "Deep Research" tool to find the answer.
You can optionally specify the number of search results to retrieve (e.g., "find 10 results").
```
Example User Prompts:
- "What are the latest advancements in AI ethics?"
- "Research the impact of climate change on ocean ecosystems, providing 7 key findings."
- "Summarize the history of the internet."

The LLM will automatically pass the query and max_results parameters to the tool.

3. Using the Tool Node (Workflow Applications)
For more structured, automated tasks, you can explicitly use a "Tool" node in a Workflow:

On the Dify Workflow orchestration canvas, click "+" to add a new node.

Select the "Tool" node.

In the Tool node's configuration panel:

Choose "Deep Research" from the "Tool" dropdown.

Map Inputs:

query: Connect this to a variable containing your search query (e.g., {{#start.query}} from a "Start" node, or a variable from an "LLM" node that extracts the query).
